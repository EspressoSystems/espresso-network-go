# Contract Artifacts

Since this [PR](https://github.com/EspressoSystems/espresso-network/pull/3062), the contract artifacts are committed
in the `espresso-network` repo and checked into the repo, which means we don't need to generate it locally.

Currently, we are using the tag `20250412-dev-node-pos-preview` which does not include this change. So files are `hardcoded` here.

The next time the tag is updated, we should use these files directly from the `espresso-network` submodule.
