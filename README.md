# Espresso Sequencer Go SDK

This package provides tools and interfaces for working with the
[Espresso sequencer](https://github.com/EspressoSystems/espresso-network) in Go. It should
(eventually) provide everything needed to integrate a rollup written in Go with the Espresso
sequencer.

## Development

- Obtain code:

        git clone git@github.com:EspressoSystems/espresso-network-go
        git submodule update --init --recursive

- Make sure [nix](https://nixos.org/download.html) is installed.
- Activate the environment with `nix-shell`, or `nix develop`, or `direnv allow` if using [direnv](https://direnv.net/).

## Verification

Run the following command to download the static library for the current platform.

    sudo go run github.com/EspressoSystems/espresso-network-go/download download

Or you can specify the version with `-v` flag.

    sudo go run github.com/EspressoSystems/espresso-network-go/download download -v 0.0.32

Build the verification library.

    go build github.com/EspressoSystems/espresso-network-go/verification

You can also clean the downloaded files with the following command.

    sudo go run github.com/EspressoSystems/espresso-network-go/download clean

## Run the linter and unit tests

    just lint
    just test

## Generating contract bindings
